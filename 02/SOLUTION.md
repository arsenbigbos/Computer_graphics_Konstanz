#### How the patterns (Moiré-Artifacts) which can be seen in figure a) arise. (1 Point)

Moiré-Artefacts are created by overlaying two images, creating a third pattern. There are many different ways this effect comes into play though it appears mostly in photography or even in printing, when the print pattern interferes with the image being printed. They are an interference pattern that can be produced when the gaps of one pattern is overlapped with a similar pattern.

#### Why these artifacts show up much less in figure b). (1 Point)

Due to the jitter, noise is created which hides the actual artifacts. It causes a random displacement of image frames, creating the effect seen in figure b).
